# Modify test3 script so that four seperate jobs are submitted
# simultaneously as an SGE JOB ARRAY.
#  
#
# Each one of the four jobs will pick just one of the job input files 
#  (fish1.in, fish2.in and fish3.in fish4.in) and will write the output into 
#  a correspondingly numbered output file. 
# For example; the output for fish1.in will be written into a file named fish1.out 
#
# HINT : An environment variable named $SGE_TASK_ID contains the job_array ID. 
#        For example for job number 2 , $SGE_TASK_ID will be set to 2 . 
#       
#        When an $environment_variable is used in a command line its value gets 
#        substituted.   So,   myfile${SGE_TASK_ID}.dat  will read as myfile2.dat 
#        for job number 2. 
./fish < fish${SGE_TASK_ID}.in  > fish${SGE_TASK_ID}.out
