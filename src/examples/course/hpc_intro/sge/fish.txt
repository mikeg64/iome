 
  Simulation of fishing.


F = total fish stock in weight units (tons)
B = total number of boats fishing.
P = price of fish (per ton)
c = fish catch per time unit ( month)
r = restocking of fish per time unit ( months )


1)	F = f( r , c )   
2)	B = f( F , P , c)
3)	P = f( c )
4)	c = f( F ,B , P ) 
5)	r = f( F ) 


Explanations : 

(1) fish stock (F) varies +vely with reproduction(r),  -vely with catching(c)
   
(2) Number of boats out fishing is determined by the price of fish and 
    amount of fish which is there.

(3) Price depends on fish caught

(4) fish catch depends on number of boats fishing , fish stock and price 

(5) reproduction rate vary with the total stock. This is a simplification
    as it varies with the mature stock which will introduce a time delay 
     which we will ignore to simplify.

   Run this simulation with different parameters for the model.


 One example : 
       F = F*r - c
       B = F/1000 - P*10 + c/100
       P = 1/c
       c = B*100 if F>F0 otherwise B*(100 - 100(F0-F)/F0 )
       r = 0.01 for F>F0 otherwise r = 0.01 - 0.01(F0- F)^2/F0
